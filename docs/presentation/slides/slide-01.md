## What is Agentic Engineering?

| Traditional Dev | Agentic Engineering |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Developer writes all code | AI agents write code with human guidance |
| Sequential workflow | Parallel swarm execution |
| Manual testing | Self-validating pipelines |
| Static architecture | Self-learning, self-optimizing |
| Hours to prototype | Minutes to prototype |

## The Shift

```
Old World:           New World:
Human → Code         Human → Intent → Agent Swarm → Code
                                          ↓
                                    Tests + Validation
                                          ↓
                                    Working System
```

## Key Principles

1. **Intent over Implementation** - Describe WHAT, agents figure out HOW
2. **Swarm Parallelism** - 6-8 agents working simultaneously
3. **Architectural Guardrails** - ADRs + DDD keep agents on track
4. **Memory & Learning** - Agents remember patterns, improve over time
5. **Human-in-the-Loop** - You steer, agents execute

## Today's Goal

> Build a fully functional AI-powered grants management system
> with semantic search, multi-tenancy, and a modern dashboard
> -- in under 2 hours.
