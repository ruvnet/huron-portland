# PRES-014: Building the Dashboard

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The dashboard is the primary user interface. It needs to display proposal statistics, status pipeline, activity feed, deadlines, and semantic search -- all assembled with AI agents.

## Decision
- Show ASCII mockup of the full dashboard layout
- Map components to file paths in the project structure
- Show how to prompt Claude Code to build the dashboard
- Include the key page component TypeScript code

## Consequences
- Concrete visual target for the build
- Component-file mapping enables parallel development
- Claude Code prompt example shows the agentic workflow in practice

## Duration
4 minutes

## Key Message
Describe the dashboard in natural language, and a swarm of agents builds it in parallel.
