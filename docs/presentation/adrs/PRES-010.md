# PRES-010: Setting Up with Codespace or Local GitHub

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Attendees need to get their development environment running. Two paths: GitHub Codespace (recommended for hackathon speed) and local setup (for those who prefer it).

## Decision
- Present both options side-by-side with a comparison card
- Recommend Codespace for the hackathon (zero friction)
- Show step-by-step for both paths
- Include a validation step to confirm everything works
- Provide decision matrix (setup time, internet, Docker, GPU, cost)

## Consequences
- Most attendees will use Codespace (fastest path)
- Local setup option ensures no one is excluded
- Validation step catches environment issues early

## Duration
3 minutes

## Key Message
For this hackathon, use Codespaces. Zero friction, 60-second start.
