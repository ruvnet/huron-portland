# PRES-016: Self-Learning with RuVector SONA

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Self-learning is a differentiating capability. The SONA engine combines Mixture of Experts, HNSW indexing, EWC++ memory preservation, and LoRA fine-tuning to create a system that improves with use.

## Decision
- Define self-learning in practical terms (system improves without retraining)
- Present SONA's 4 components with clear descriptions
- Show the self-learning feedback loop (search → interact → learn → improve)
- Connect to Claude Flow memory namespaces for pattern storage
- Show concrete CLI commands for storing and retrieving learned patterns

## Consequences
- Attendees understand self-learning as practical, not theoretical
- Memory namespace system makes the concept actionable
- Feedback loop shows how improvement compounds over time

## Duration
4 minutes

## Key Message
The system learns from every interaction. Result #3 today becomes result #1 tomorrow.
