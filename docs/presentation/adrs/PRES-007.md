# PRES-007: Domain-Driven Design for AI Agents

## Status
Accepted

## Context
DDD provides the domain context that AI agents need to write correct business logic. Without DDD, agents produce technically valid but domain-incorrect code.

## Decision
- Introduce DDD building blocks: Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, Domain Events, Value Objects
- Map to concrete project examples (7 contexts, 6 aggregates, 60+ events)
- Show the context map with relationships between bounded contexts
- Explain why DDD matters specifically for AI agents (ubiquitous language, boundaries, events)

## Consequences
- Attendees understand DDD as a practical tool, not academic theory
- Direct mapping to project code makes concepts tangible
- Foundation for understanding anti-drift patterns in next slide

## Duration
4 minutes

## Key Message
DDD gives AI agents a shared language and clear boundaries to work within.
