# PRES-012: Modern Frontend with Next.js 14 + WASM

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The frontend uses Next.js 14 App Router with server components, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and a WASM vector search engine for offline capability.

## Decision
- Show the App Router file structure with page-level data fetching
- Present 3-tier component architecture (pages → domain → primitives)
- Show WASM vector search TypeScript code for rvlite
- Present the online/offline strategy as a flow diagram

## Consequences
- Modern Next.js patterns demonstrated in context
- WASM integration demystified with practical code
- Offline-first approach differentiates the project

## Duration
4 minutes

## Key Message
Server components for performance, WASM for offline, shadcn/ui for rapid UI assembly.
