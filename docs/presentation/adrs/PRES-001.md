# PRES-001: Welcome & Agentic Engineering Introduction

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Opening slide for the Bangalore Hackathon needs to establish what Agentic Engineering is, why it matters, and set the tone for the entire session. Attendees may range from junior developers to senior architects.

## Decision
- Open with a clear definition of Agentic Engineering as a paradigm shift
- Use a comparison table (Traditional vs Agentic) for immediate understanding
- State the session goal upfront: build a working prototype in under 2 hours
- Keep the energy high but grounded in practical outcomes

## Consequences
- Sets clear expectations for the session
- Provides a shared vocabulary for all attendees
- May alienate attendees unfamiliar with AI tools (mitigated by hands-on setup in slides 3-4)

## Duration
4 minutes

## Key Message
Agentic Engineering is about intent-driven development where AI agent swarms execute in parallel, guided by architectural guardrails.
