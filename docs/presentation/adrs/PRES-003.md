# PRES-003: Installing Claude Code

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Attendees need to install Claude Code quickly and understand its capabilities. Multiple installation methods should be presented to accommodate different environments.

## Decision
- Present 3 installation methods: npm (recommended), Homebrew, direct download
- Show first-run setup including API key configuration
- Highlight key capabilities in a feature table
- Introduce CLAUDE.md as the critical configuration file

## Consequences
- npm method works across all platforms
- API key requirement may block some attendees (mitigated by providing trial keys)
- CLAUDE.md introduction primes attendees for ADR/DDD slides later

## Duration
3 minutes

## Key Message
Claude Code reads your entire codebase and CLAUDE.md is your AI instruction manual.
