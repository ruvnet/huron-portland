# PRES-018: Live Build - Prototype in Under 2 Hours

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The live build is the centerpiece of the hackathon. Attendees follow along as a complete grants management prototype is assembled using agentic engineering principles.

## Decision
- Present a 5-phase build plan with clear boundaries
- Phase 1: Setup (15 min) - Environment and Docker
- Phase 2: Backend (30 min) - Go swarm builds domain + handlers
- Phase 3: Frontend (30 min) - Next.js swarm builds UI
- Phase 4: Integration (30 min) - E2E testing and demo data
- Phase 5: Demo Prep (15 min) - Rehearsal and verification
- Show specific Claude Code prompts for each phase
- End with a checklist of what was built

## Consequences
- Structured approach prevents time overruns
- Swarm prompts are reusable templates
- Checklist provides clear success criteria

## Duration
4 minutes

## Key Message
5 phases, each with a swarm. From zero to working prototype with tests.
