# PRES-002: The Agentic Toolchain Overview

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Attendees need to understand the three core tools (Claude Code, Claude Flow, RuVector) and how they relate before diving into installation details.

## Decision
- Present the toolchain as a layered stack diagram
- Show the connection flow: Developer Intent → Claude Code → Claude Flow Swarm → RuVector → Results
- Assign clear roles to each tool with a comparison table
- Introduce the R-A-B-F-T agent pattern (Researcher, Architect, Backend, Frontend, Tester)

## Consequences
- Creates a mental model for the full toolchain
- Allows attendees to understand where each tool fits before installing

## Duration
4 minutes

## Key Message
Three tools, one workflow: Claude Code writes, Claude Flow orchestrates, RuVector searches.
