# PRES-006: Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Most attendees will not be familiar with ADRs. They need to understand what ADRs are, why they matter for agentic engineering, and how they serve as guardrails for AI agents.

## Decision
- Define ADRs with a simple anatomy diagram (Status, Context, Decision, Consequences)
- Show comparison table: development with vs without ADRs
- List all 10 project ADRs with brief descriptions
- Connect ADRs to CLAUDE.md as agent instructions

## Consequences
- Establishes ADRs as a core practice, not just documentation
- Primes attendees for the drift prevention slide (08)

## Duration
3 minutes

## Key Message
ADRs are not documentation -- they are executable instructions for AI agents.
